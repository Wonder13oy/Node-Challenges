## About

### Memory Game
A game that tests a person's memory. All the cards are placed facing down and you attempt to find the matching ones.
When you find the two cards that do not match, you flip them back over. When you do find cards that do match, leave
them that way. The game was made using NodeJs and Javascript. It is hosted on port 8080
